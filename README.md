Smart India Hackathon

Welcome to the GitHub repository of Team Bazinga, Galgotias University for the Smart India Hackathon! We are a team of passionate students working on innovative solutions to real-world problems.

Problem Statement

The problem statement that we are working on for the Smart India Hackathon is:
PS code:1355
Developing solutions to effective market linkage and promotion of One District One Product.
One District One Product (ODOP) is a government-led initiative aimed at promoting and marketing the unique and diverse products of Jammu and Kashmir. The program was launched with the goal of providing a platform for the local artisans and entrepreneurs to showcase their skills and to promote the local products. The focus of the initiative is to encourage the development of small and micro-enterprises, thereby creating job opportunities and boosting the local economy. The ODOP initiative covers a wide range of products, including traditional handicrafts, textiles, carpets, shawls, and dry fruits, among others. The products are manufactured using locally sourced materials, preserving the rich cultural heritage of the region. The initiative also focuses on modernizing the traditional production methods, thereby improving the quality and consistency of the products being produced. UT of Jammu and Kashmir is endowed with several diverse and niche products from each district. Ranging from high-value agricultural and horticultural produce to unique handicraft and textile products. Yet, several challenges still persist in wider outreach and equitable remuneration to local producers and artisans. Scope for developing unique software-based solutions exist at each stage from producers to final consumers; including innovative solutions for ensuring traceability through block chain, to development of platforms for direct market linkages etc. Proposal are expected to provide an in-depth understanding of the supply chain and the involved stakeholders, of specific ODOP and design hardware or software-based solution to address the challenges of a fragmented supply chain.
Solution

We’re here for a solution by creating an android and web-based portals that will serve as a platform for local artisan , vendors and craftsmen to showcase their rich cultures and traditions under the scheme of ODOP , to promote local startups and boost rural and  small-scale industries. 


Implementation
Users, including artisans, producers, buyers, and government officials, can register on the platform. KYC verification is performed to ensure the authenticity of users.
Artisans and producers from different districts of Jammu and Kashmir can select their respective district and the specific product they want to promote under the ODOP scheme.
The core of the platform relies on Blockchain technology for data security and transparency.
Registered artisans and producers can list their products on the platform, including product details, images, pricing, and production capacity .
The platform includes an e-commerce marketplace where buyers, both domestic and international, can browse and purchase ODOP products.
Blockchain records and verifies eligibility criteria, simplifying the application process.
The platform’s  algorithm provides insights into market trends, demand, and supply patterns, helping artisans make informed decisions.

Buyers can leave reviews and feedback; this feedback loop helps artisans improve their products and build trust with consumers.
Government officials have access to real-time data on the platform, enabling them to monitor the progress of the ODOP scheme effectively

We are using a variety of technologies to implement our solution, including:
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT: basic wed development langauges.
Google Maps API: To track the location of public transportation vehicles in real time.
Firebase: To store and manage user data and vehicle data.
blockchain: To predict the estimated time of arrival of vehicles.
Progress

We have made significant progress on our solution so far. We have developed a prototype of the web , and we are currently testing it.
